        <h1>Manulex_Morpho v.2. - General description</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p> <i>Manulex_morpho</i> provides information on the frequency and
        consistency of G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences for a subset of words from
        the <i>Manulex</i> database (approximatively 10,000 words). The latter
        indexes all the words included in a selection of Grade 1 to 5 school
        textbooks published and available in France (Lété, Sprenger-Charolles,
        &amp; Colé, 2004). The <i>Manulex_morpho</i> database indexes 20% of
        the lexical entries (i.e: the denominator reflects each word in the
        corpus, counted once) in the textbooks, which represents more than 90%
        of the textual entries (i.e:, the denominator reflects all the words in
        the corpus, including their reoccurrence in the textbooks). </p>
      <p> Contrary to other databases published (<i>Manulex_infra</i>; Peereman,
        Lété, &amp; Sprenger-Charolles, 2007), <i>Manulex_morpho</i>accounts
        for the morphological structure of written words, which represents its
        most valuable contribution to the field. Four categories of
        morphological markers were used to index graphemes and phonemes in the
        database, mostly located in at the ends of words: 1. Nominal inflections
        marking gender and number; 2. Verbal inflections; 3. Morpho-graphemes
        such as 'ent' in adverbs (rarement, vivement, vraiment); 4 Final
        consonants in a word, which are silent but can be pronounced when
        inflected (for example 'd' in 'grand-grande-grandeur'). </p>
      <p> For each word, the <i>Manulex_morpho</i> database provide the G-Ph
        and Ph-G frequency and consistency depending on their position in words:
        initial (first grapheme/phoneme), final (last grapheme/phoneme), and
        intermediate (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of words). It also
        provides two types of mean consistency and frequency, regardless of
        position in a word: one lexical and the other textual. The lexical
        frequency (i.e. Count by-type) reflects the number of words in the
        database that include a G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences, whereby each word
        is only counted once. Text frequency (i.e. Count by-token) reflects the
        number of words in the texts that include a correspondence of interest,
        whereby a word is strictly counted as often as it appears in the corpus.
        For example: In the database, there are 13 words that include the G-Ph
        correspondence 'ch' - /k/, therefore its lexical frequency is 13. The
        total sum of occurrences of those 13 words in the corpus of text is 136,
        and this is therefore the textual frequency of G-Ph and Ph-G
        correspondences. Note that a large number of alternative pronunciations
        to the grapheme 'ch' exist in French: 'ch' occurs in an additional 565
        words in the database, with a cumulative frequency of 18,289. The
        consistency of 'ch' - /k/ is therefore fairly low in French. In the
        database, consistency is expressed as a percentage, obtained from the
        ratio of the correspondence’s own frequency over the grapheme’s overall
        frequency. For 'ch' - /k/ lexical consistency is 2.25% (13/[565 + 13]) x
        100 = 2.25%) and textual consistency – derived via the same calculation
        only using textual frequency data – is 0.74% (136/[18 289 + 136]) x 100
        = 0.74%). </p>
