      <p>In alphabetic scripts, the degree of G-Ph and Ph-G consistency predicts
        the speed of reading and writing acquisition. Learning to read and write
        is easier and faster when G-Ph and Ph-G are more consistent, and
        consistency is commonly used as an index to determine the level of
        difficulty of printed words. </p>
      <p>The <i>Manulex_Morpho</i> database provides information on the
        frequency and consistency of G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences for a subset
        of words from the Manulex database (approximatively 10,000 words). The
        latter indexes all the words included in a selection of Grade 1 to 5
        school textbooks published and available in France (Lété,
        Sprenger-Charolles, &amp; Colé, 2004). The <i>Manulex_Morpho</i>
        database indexes 20% of the lexical entries (i.e: the denominator
        reflects each word in the corpus, counted once) in the textbooks, which
        represents more than 90% of the textual entries (i.e:, the denominator
        reflects all the words in the corpus, including their reoccurrence in
        the textbooks). For each word, the <i>Manulex_Morpho</i> database
        provide the G-Ph and Ph-G frequency and consistency depending on their
        position in words: initial (first grapheme/phoneme), final (last
        grapheme/phoneme), and intermediate (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of
        words). It also provides two types of mean consistency and frequency,
        regardless of position in a word: one lexical and the other textual. The
        lexical frequency (i.e. Count by-type) reflects the number of words in
        the database that include a G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences, whereby each
        word is only counted once. Text frequency (i.e. Count by-token) reflects
        the number of words in the texts that include a correspondence of
        interest, whereby a word is strictly counted as often as it appears in
        the corpus. For example: In the database, there are 13 words that
        include the G-Ph correspondence 'ch' - /k/, therefore its lexical
        frequency is 13. The total sum of occurrences of those 13 words in the
        corpus of text is 136, and this is therefore the textual frequency of
        G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences. Note that a large number of alternative
        pronunciations to the grapheme 'ch' exist in French: 'ch' occurs in an
        additional 565 words in the database, with a cumulative frequency of
        18,289. The consistency of 'ch' - /k/ is therefore fairly low in French.
        In the database, consistency is expressed as a percentage, obtained from
        the ratio of the correspondence’s own frequency over the grapheme’s
        overall frequency. For 'ch' - /k/ lexical consistency is 2.25% (13/[565
        + 13]) x 100 = 2.25%) and textual consistency – derived via the same
        calculation only using textual frequency data – is 0.74% (136/[18 289 +
        136]) x 100 = 0.74%).</p>
      <p>A specific difficulty of the French writing system lies in how the
        language’s morphology is transcribed in print. For instance, nominal
        inflection markers ('e', 's' and 'x') or verbal inflection markers ('e',
        'es', 'ent'…) are represented in writing but remain silent when a word
        is pronounced or read aloud. This plays an important role in the degree
        of consistency of the language spelling correspondences. Contrary to
        other databases published (<i>Manulex_Infra</i>; Peereman, Lété, &amp;
        Sprenger-Charolles, 2007), <i>Manulex_Morpho</i> accounts for the
        morphological structure of written words, which represents its most
        valuable contribution to the field. Four categories of morphological
        markers were used to index graphemes and phonemes in the database,
        mostly located in at the ends of words: <br>
        - Nominal inflections marking gender and number; <br>
        - Verbal inflections;<br>
        - Morpho-graphemes such as 'ent' in adverbs (rarement, vivement,
        vraiment); <br>
        - Final consonants in a word, which are silent but can be pronounced
        when inflected (for example 'd' in 'grand-grande-grandeur').</p>
      <br>

      <p><b> Website functionality</b></p>
      <br>
      <p> The <i>Manulex_Morpho</i> database can be viewed on the 'Research'
        tab of the website. It can be queried in two different ways: using the
        'simple' search or the more 'advanced search' function which caters to
        the design of instructional sequences for a literacy program. </p>
      <p>The <i>simple search</i> function allows users to find specific
        characteristics of words in the database. For example, the function can
        calculate the average C-Ph consistency of the words 'fraise' or
        'voisin'.
        The 'simple search' function also allows users to enter specific
        characteristics and retrieve matching words from the database. For
        example, users can query the database for four to six letter words in
        which mean Ph-G correspondences consistency is high.</p>
      <p>The <i>advanced search</i> function is suited to the elaborate needs
        of explicit, structured literacy instruction programs. Such programs
        introduce G-Ph and Ph-G progressively, in separate sequences, predefined
        by specific criteria such as frequency and consistency. Paired with
        systematic decoding instructions, the progressive introduction of G-Ph
        and Ph-G allows children to incrementally grow the repertoire of words
        with which they can read and write. The advanced search function enables
        educators to query the database using criteria relevant to French
        orthography and their learners. Prior to using the advanced search,
        users must determine 1) the different G-Ph or Ph-G correspondences of
        interest, and 2) the progression, meaning the order in which each
        correspondence is to be gradually introduced throughout the duration of
        the program (e.g. from 1 to 10 if there are 10 learning sequences). The
        'advanced search' will query the database for words that include 1) each
        G-Ph or Ph-G correspondence of interest and 2) G-Ph or Ph-G
        correspondences previously introduced in the progression. The search
        output is a custom-made word list that is used to teach and practice
        decoding incrementally, one grapheme at a time. </p>
