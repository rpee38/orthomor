        <h1>Understanding Manulex_infra</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p> The computations fall into two categories: word-length characteristics
        and grade-level characteristics. The word-length characteristics are the
        numbers of letters, phonemes, graphemes, and syllables in the word.
        Contrary to word-length characteristics, grade-level characteristics are
        function of the word corpus analyzed. They were computed on the four
        Manulex-wordform lexicons corresponding to the four levels, G1, G2,
        G3-5, and G1-5, that is, words found in first-grade readers,
        second-grade readers, third-to-fifth-grade readers, and all readers,
        which were put into four statistical datafiles, Manu1, Manu2, Manu35,
        and ManuAll, respectively. There are type-based and token-based
        computations. The lexical frequency (i.e. Count by-type) reflects the
        number of words in the database that include a G-Ph and Ph-G
        correspondences, whereby each word is only counted once. Text frequency
        (i.e. Count by-token) reflects the number of words in the texts that
        include a correspondence of interest, whereby a word is strictly counted
        as often as it appears in the corpus The computations carried out on
        each of the four lexicons are detailed below. </p>
      <p><b>Association frequencies, GP-consistency and PG-consistency values</b>.
        The ambiguity of phonological encoding from orthographic input, and the
        ambiguity of orthographic encoding from phonological input, are
        generally estimated by consistency index. In Manulex-Infra, the
        GP-consistency index is equal to the frequency at which a particular
        grapheme-phoneme mapping occurs divided by the total frequency of the
        grapheme, no matter how it is pronounced. For example, the
        GP-consistency index of the association "ch"-&gt;/S/ (as in the word
        "chat" /Sa/) is obtained by dividing the frequency of occurrence of the
        "ch"-&gt;/S/ association by the frequency of the grapheme "ch",
        irrespective of its pronunciation (including /S/, but also /k/ for
        example, as in "choral" /koRal/). The GP-consistency index was then
        multiplied by 100. Its maximal value (total consistency) is 100.
        Similarly, the PG-consistency index is equal to the frequency at which a
        particular phoneme-grapheme mapping occurs, divided by the total
        frequency of the phoneme multiplied by 100, no matter how the phoneme is
        spelled. </p>
      <p>Consistency can differ greatly as a function of the serial position of
        the units in the word. In particular, due to the derivational morphology
        of French, word endings are often silent, so spelling is less
        transparent. To better characterize the orthography-phonology mappings
        of French, frequency and consistency were computed as a function of the
        relative serial position (initial, middle, final) of the units in the
        words. The results are included in each word entry, together with the
        average value and the value of the word's least frequent and the least
        consistent associations. </p>
      <p>Finally, separate tables provide summary statistics on the frequency
        and consistency values of all associations found in the word corpora. </p>
      <p><b>Infra-lexical unit frequencies</b>. Bigrams, biphones, and syllable
        frequencies were computed for each entry at the four levels. Bigram
        frequency is the frequency of occurrence of each two-letter sequence in
        the word list. Transposed to phonology, biphone frequency is the
        frequency of occurrence of each two-phoneme sequence in the word list.
        Finally, syllable frequency was computed from the syllabic segmentations
        of phonological wordforms. Computations were type-based and token-based,
        and were performed separately for the different units (bigram, biphone,
        syllable) as a function of their relative serial position in the word
        (initial, middle, final). Supplementary databases provide summary
        statistics on bigrams, biphones, and syllable frequencies. Letter,
        phoneme, and trigram frequency tables are also available. </p>
      <p><b>Orthographic and phonographic neighborhood</b>. Lexical neighborhood
        density was computed to assess lexical similarities between words.
        Orthographic neighbors are operationally defined as words that can be
        generated from the base letter string by a single letter substitution.
        For example, FACE, RICE, RATE, and RACK are orthographic neighbors of
        the word RACE. Because orthographic neighborhood density depends on the
        specific orthographic wordforms known by the children, values at the
        four levels were computed separately (first grade, second grade, third
        to fifth grades, all grades). Neighborhood density is type-based and
        token-based. The type-based measure corresponds to the raw number of
        orthographic neighbors. The token-based measure takes neighbor frequency
        into account by summing the frequency of all neighbors. Note that if two
        (or more) neighbors are homographs, they are counted only once, and
        their frequencies are summed. </p>
      <p>Adult reading aloud (Peereman &amp; Content, 1997) has been shown to be
        facilitated by a particular subtype of orthographic neighbor, namely
        ones that are also phonologically similar to the target word. These
        lexical neighbors, referred to as phonographic are both orthographically
        and phonologically similar to the word to be pronounced.Phonographic
        neighborhood density was therefore computed in addition to orthographic
        neighborhood. Phonological similarity between words was estimated by
        applying the orthographic-neighbor operationalization to phonological
        forms. Hence, words were considered to be phonologically similar when
        they differed by a single phoneme. The computation results are
        incorporated in the main word databases (Manu1, Manu2, Manu35, ManuAll),
        and the neighbors are listed in separate files (NO1, NO2, NO35, NOall
        for Orthographic neighbors; NOP1, NOP2, NOP35, NOPall for Phonographic
        neighbors), along with their frequency. </p>
      <p><b>Homophones and homographs</b>. The number of homophones and the
        number of homographs for each entry were also computed at the four
        levels. Again, type-based and token-based computations were performed.
        Type-based and token-based values were added to the databases. The words
        entering into the computations are listed in separate files, along with
        their frequency (HG1, HG2, HG35, and HGall for heterophonic HomoGraphs;
        HP1, HP2, HP35, and HPall for heterographic HomoPhones). </p>
      <p><b>Orthographic uniqueness point</b>. In studies on auditory word
        recognition, the phonological unicity point is traditionally defined as
        the serial position of the phoneme (counting from the first phoneme in
        the word) at which the target word diverges from other lexical
        candidates. Transposed to orthographic forms, uniqueness point refers to
        the serial position of the letter (counting from left to right) at which
        the target word diverges from any other lexical candidates. Orthographic
        uniqueness point is given for each word in each grade level. </p>
